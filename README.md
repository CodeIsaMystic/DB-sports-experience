# Getting Started

The D.B.S.H is a frontend project, built in HTML5/CSS3 and Native Javascript, this simplified template was made on the purpose to practice and develop some professionals code in a professionnal mode and environment. 
This project was thought with a potential client who does not needed so much applications for his website but after all a simple window to the web, just like a portfolio. Getting some more contacts, to store on a database, this frontend theme could be linked to a combo "PHP/SQL" backend but maybe, more efficiently it could be handled with javascript in a JAM Stack app with node, express and a database.
