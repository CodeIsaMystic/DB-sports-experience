###### D.B.S.H CASE STUDY - 2019 / 2020

## **Provide a website mockup for a personal trainer, seeking a web solution for a window open to the web. A simple product but effective, modern, good looking with some of the best practices and simples applications.** 
**The client doesn't have any experience on the question, so the effort was placed on different parts. A good design. A modern and representative mockup. Some simple functionalities, efficient with also basics animations too.**

Basic graphical exercise...<br/>
Working on a professional context with SCRUM Methodology<br/>

I initiate this case study in a frontend thought, without providing any Backend solutions. Later I used this project to validate my developer of web site and web applications.
