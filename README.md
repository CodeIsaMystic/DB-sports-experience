###### D.B.S.H CASE STUDY - 2019 / 2020

# <h1 align="center">Mastering the Modern Workflow</h1>


## **Provide a website mockup for a personal trainer, seeking a web solution for a window open to the web. A simple product but effective, modern, good looking with some of the best practices and simples applications.** 
**The client doesn't have any experience on the question, so the effort was placed on different parts. A good design. A modern and representative mockup. Some simple functionalities, efficient with also basics animations too.**



###### **MY ROLE**

Lead, Develop and Design - keeping a short and efficient communication with the client, developing, testing and applying, exploring possibilities in relation with the needs of the project, making choices

###### **WORKED WITH**

HTML 5 structure and semantic<br/>
Pure CSS & Native Javascript<br/> 
Bootstrap 4, PHP & MySQL on the Backend<br/> 
NPM: Webpack, PostCSS, Babel...<br/>
SMACSS files architecture, BEM methodology<br/>
Basic graphical exercise...<br/>
Working on a professional context with SCRUM Methodology<br/>



###### **NOTE**


I initiate this case study in a frontend thought, without providing any Backend solutions. Later, I used this project to validate my developer of web site and web applications. I tryed to find some Backend solutions, using PHP, Bootstrap 4 and MySQL, but the effort was essentially made on the Frontend part. I truly like the idea of serverless technologies. 





######  **PROBLEM**

## **How to respond to a client need which not have any budget or experiences... The problem was to propose a modern product, started from scratch, handling all aspects of a web project without expertise but simply a sense of professional way to do. How to think in Design, in Landing Page Optimization, in UI/UX, in Frontend and Backend programming solutions and finally how to find out, giving for the client an easy way to published, manage the application...**






It was tuff for a Junior Developer to start from scratch, thinking in Design, UX and  being efficient. I spent my time to find out some solutions, every times trying to be professional, offering some professional responses. 
We focused on simples applications because it wasn't necessary to develop more the concept. The client, already have a current position as personal trainer, it's just an additional activity and he already have some personals clients. We was just wondering to build a "Window Open to the Web". We didn't need complicates applications or functionalities. On that purpose, I choose to develop some basics animations, some basics functionalities. I thought that doing simple and effective, could be a better idea in that situation. 

Regarding the case study, there was some personals goals to reach out. I made this project a sum of challenges I must had to do. Building a web site with a modern workflow, using NPM, Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, Git bash. Developing animations on pure Vanilla Javascript, stylesheets on B.E.M Methodology, organizing files on a architecture, thinking "patterns" or "components" on a Atomic Design purpose...


In term of Landing Page Optimization, we only focused on two main goals...

 First of all, trying to sue the website to give more infos and getting new contact.
 And in a the second thought, maybe that starting a Newsletter campaign could be a great idea for his business. 

In these thoughts, I propose to lead the project on the frontend and explain how to use some tools like "Mailchimp" managing, styling his campaign easily and efficiently. That's only after, I decided to use it for a student project validation of my degree. So, I choose to go deep and program a simple backend admin dashboard with bootstrap, and trying to connect it with PHP and MySQL.
